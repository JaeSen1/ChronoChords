         <p>Upon loading the game, you'll be presented with a user interface that includes a play button. Click on it to begin your musical journey.</p>
         <p>You'll be treated to a snippet of a song. Listen closely, and let the rhythms, melodies, and lyrics jog your memory or provide clues about the era it might be from.</p>
         <p>Once you've listened to the snippet, it's time to guess the release year of the song. Use the slider or input box provided to select a year.</p>
         <p>After you've made your selection, click on the "Submit" button. The closer your guess is to the actual release year, the higher your score will be!</p>
         <p>After submitting your guess, a summary popup will appear, revealing the correct year, the song title, and the artist. This is a great chance to learn more and perhaps discover some new songs to add to your personal playlist!</p>
